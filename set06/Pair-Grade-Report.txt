Notes:

Data Design
* itemization templates must have as many clauses as the data defn
* why does is-attribute-list? call (list? ...) when we know that the signature
  says it can only receive a list?

Function Specification
* depth-further and extract-further need better purpose statements and names

Implementation
* attribute-value doesn't follow template -- why not? having to diverge from the
  template is a sign to rethink your design, task decomposition, etc.
* same for xexpr-depth, extract-further, depth-further
* nice use of map + filter in xexpr-find

Style
* don't put parens on separate lines (e.g. list-of-attributes?, crawl-data)
