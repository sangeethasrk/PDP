Notes:
	Data Definition:
		- world missing interp
		- Invariants missing in Data  Definition
	Func Specs:-	
		- get-goalscore - missing signature, purp stmt
		- Same issue with key-handler, check-if-inactive? and many others
	Imlementation:-
		- Can't use cond unless data is itemized - get-wallendpt
		- update-wall-list - could have used an abstraction
		- update-ydir - function too cmplx
	Style:-
		Magic Constants used in get-goalscore

Deductions:

Online Total:             10/20

Notes:
- code doesnt run - incomplete so limited the questions we could
- was able to identify invariants for Number, not for level, goal-score, etc
==
- key-handler: asked about strategy - identified data decomp on world but not keyevent
- update-ball: asked about cond: answered that cond is used for fn comp
- asked about abstraction for within-wall-limits?: ormap - could not identify andmap
- presentation - lots of ums

Overall Score: 22/50

Other Notes:
