Deductions:

	Data Design:-
		In Case of Mixed Data instead of writing "list-broadcast-fn" decompose the sub - parts 
		   (i.e the template should reflect the data definition)
		Where are the list-broadcast-fn, list-error-fn ... defintions
		Interpretation missing for MsgToLog.
		Template signatures missing
		Invariants missing in Editor Data defn
	Function Implementation:-
		Don't dump the test suite in example.
		Write proper functions statements
	Implentation:-
		use of cond in update-cursor is incorrect
		(reverse (rest (reverse lst))) -> There is a better way to write this
	Style:
		Test Coverage Missing:- (-2)
