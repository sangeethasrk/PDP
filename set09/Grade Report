Notes:
You missed capturing Generative Recursion and a termination argument which was essential to the program.
Important Note:
And Sivaram/Geet: I was wrong when I said Binary search and Merge sort was Structural recursion. You were right when you said that anything other than linear traversal of list with say, Divide and Conquer is Generative Recursion. I checked the course website and realized my mistake.
